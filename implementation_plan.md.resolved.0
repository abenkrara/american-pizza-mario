# Implementation Plan - American Pizza Mario

## Goal
Build a comprehensive, feature-rich website for "American Pizza Mario" (Chiva & Cheste) including a dynamic reservation system and admin dashboard.

## User Review Required
- **Menu (Carta)**: Please provide the full menu (images or text).
- **Branding**: Do you have a logo? Preferred colors? (Search suggests Red/White/Green or US Flag colors possibly?)
- **Reservation Logic**: How many tables? Time slots?
- **Tech Stack Approval**: Proposing **Next.js** (React) to handle the complex logic of reservations and the admin dashboard within a single application.

## Proposed Changes
### Project Structure (Next.js)
- `american_pizza_mario/`
  - `app/`:
    - `page.tsx`: Landing page.
    - `menu/page.tsx`: Interactive menu.
    - `locales/page.tsx`: Info about Chiva and Cheste locations.
    - `reservas/page.tsx`: Customer reservation form.
    - `admin/page.tsx`: Password-protected dashboard for owners.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components (Navbar, Footer, PizzaCard, ReservationForm).
  - `lib/`: Helper functions (Email sender, Database mock).

### Key Features
1.  **Dual Location Support**: Explicitly mention Chiva and Cheste.
2.  **Digital Menu**: Categorized, mouth-watering visuals.
3.  **Reservation Engine**:
    -   Select Location -> Date -> Time -> Party Size.
    -   Email confirmation triggers on success.
4.  **Admin Panel**: Simple view for owners to see upcoming bookings.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- linting.
- build check.

### Manual Verification
- Test Reservation Flow: Create a booking -> Check Admin Panel -> Verify "Email" (console log or simulated).
- Verify Mobile Responsiveness on all pages.
